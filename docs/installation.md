Installation
============

Stable release
--------------

To install pypums, run this command in your terminal:

``` {.console}
$ pip install pypums
```

This is the preferred method to install pypums, as it will always
install the most recent stable release.

If you don\'t have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python
installation
guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.

From sources
------------

The sources for pypums can be downloaded from the [Github
repo](https://github.com/chekos/pypums).

You can either clone the public repository:

``` {.console}
$ git clone git://github.com/chekos/pypums
```

Or download the
[tarball](https://github.com/chekos/pypums/tarball/master):

``` {.console}
$ curl  -OL https://github.com/chekos/pypums/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```
